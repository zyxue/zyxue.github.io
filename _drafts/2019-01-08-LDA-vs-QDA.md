As a quick note for myself about linear discriminant analysis and quadratic
discriminant analysis, summarizing [@ttnphns's
answer](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/71571/112141):


* FDA is LDA when considering only two classes, so FDA is a special case of LDA (This could be wrong!!!)
* LDA assumes the covariance matrices of Gaussians of different classes are the
  same, which results in **linear** decision boundary, while QDA doesn't, which
  results in **quadratic** decision boundary, hence their names.

e.g. for two classes, when the covariances are indeed the same, LDA and QDA lead
to the same decision boundary, see the two subplots (first row) on the following example,
