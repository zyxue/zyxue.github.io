This is the slides for a talk I gave in a
[data science meetup](https://www.meetup.com/LearnDataScience/events/241711656/),
in which I summarized the results of a Kaggle competition on
[diabetic retinopathy detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection)
with deep learning. In addition, I've also introduced briefly the vision system,
artificial neural networks (ANN), and the minimal relationship between the two.

I realized that this particular competition is interesting in such way: image
recognition with ANN was originally inspired by the vision system, and now
intriguingly, ANN is reapplied back to help with detection of problematic vision
system.
