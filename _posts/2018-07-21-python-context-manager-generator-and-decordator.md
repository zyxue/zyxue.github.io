1. Context manager

Setup and tear down action before and after some execution (e.g. open a
file, database, etc.)

2. Generator

syntax Sequencential operations that interleave with operation from another
party (e.g. user, other library code, etc.). Related to context manager in the
way that setup and tear down are interleaved with the code in between.

3. Decorator

A function that returns a function


*Reference*: James Powell - So you want to be a Python expert,
?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKPlPJyQrt4. The example that demonstrates the
use of three core features in Python: generator, decorate, and context manager,
is insightful!
